# PlatoVue Presentation Slides
## Slide-by-Slide Guide with Speaker Notes

---

## SLIDE 1: Title

### Visual
- **Title:** PlatoVue
- **Subtitle:** Recruiting Intelligence for Modern TA Teams
- **Tagline:** "Turn ATS exports into actionable insights"

### Speaker Notes
> "Today I'm going to show you how we're transforming the way TA leadership makes decisions - moving from reactive spreadsheet analysis to proactive, real-time recruiting intelligence."

---

## SLIDE 2: The Problem (Part 1)

### Visual
**Headline:** "TA Leaders Spend 4-8 Hours Per Week Building Reports"

Show: Image of complex spreadsheet with multiple tabs, pivot tables, VLOOKUP formulas

### Speaker Notes
> "Raise your hand if you've spent a Friday afternoon wrestling with ATS exports in Excel. Every TA leader I talk to describes the same pain - hours spent just getting data into a usable format, and by the time the report is done, it's already stale."

---

## SLIDE 3: The Problem (Part 2)

### Visual
**Headline:** "By The Time You See The Problem, It's Too Late"

Timeline graphic:
\`\`\`
Week 1: Req goes stale (nobody notices)
Week 2: Still stale (no alert)
Week 3: Still stale (buried in spreadsheet)
Week 4: Monthly report reveals problem
Week 5: Action taken (4 weeks too late)
\`\`\`

### Speaker Notes
> "The real cost isn't the report-building time - it's the opportunity cost. When problems hide in data for weeks before surfacing, you lose candidates, miss goals, and spend all your time firefighting instead of strategic work."

---

## SLIDE 4: The Problem (Part 3)

### Visual
**Headline:** "The Hiring Manager Black Box"

Two pie charts:
- "Where Candidates Drop Off" - largest slice at "HM Review"
- "Where TA Has Visibility" - slice at "HM Review" is grayed out

### Speaker Notes
> "Here's the dirty secret of recruiting metrics - the biggest controllable factor in candidate drop-off is hiring manager responsiveness, but most TA teams have zero visibility into which HMs are the problem. ATS tracks when things happen, but not when they SHOULD have happened."

---

## SLIDE 5: The Solution

### Visual
**Headline:** "PlatoVue: Decision-Grade Recruiting Analytics"

Three-step flow:
\`\`\`
CSV Export → Smart Processing → Actionable Insights
(seconds)     (automatic)        (immediate)
\`\`\`

### Speaker Notes
> "PlatoVue takes the raw exports you're already pulling from your ATS and transforms them into decision-grade intelligence. No IT integration required. Import a CSV, get insights in seconds."

---

## SLIDE 6: Demo - Control Tower

### Visual
Screenshot of Control Tower with callouts:
1. Health KPIs (5 cards with red/yellow/green)
2. Risk Queue (prioritized list)
3. Action Queue (who needs to do what)
4. Forecast Panel

### Speaker Notes
> "This is Control Tower - your executive command center. In 30 seconds, you can see: Are we healthy? What's at risk? What actions are overdue? And what's our forecast for the quarter? Let me show you each section..."

---

## SLIDE 7: Control Tower - KPIs Deep Dive

### Visual
Show the 5 KPI cards with explanation:

| KPI | What It Measures | Why It Matters |
|-----|------------------|----------------|
| Median TTF | Days to fill (excluding zombies) | Core efficiency metric |
| Offers | Count this period | Leading indicator |
| Accept Rate | Offers accepted % | Candidate experience |
| Stalled Reqs | No activity 14-30 days | Early warning |
| HM Latency | Avg feedback time | Bottleneck indicator |

### Speaker Notes
> "These aren't vanity metrics - each one is chosen because it's actionable. Median TTF uses clean data excluding zombie reqs, so you're measuring real performance. Stalled reqs is your early warning before things become zombies. HM Latency shows you where candidates are waiting."

---

## SLIDE 8: Control Tower - Risk Detection

### Visual
Show risk queue with color-coded items:

\`\`\`
[RED] Offer pending 9 days - Jane Smith, Sr. Engineer
      → Candidate will accept elsewhere if no action today

[ORANGE] Zombie req - REQ-1234, Data Scientist
         → 45 days no activity, close or source

[YELLOW] Pipeline gap - REQ-5678, Product Manager
         → Zero candidates, priority req
\`\`\`

### Speaker Notes
> "The system automatically surfaces risks by priority. Red means 'act today or lose something.' Orange means 'will become critical this week.' We're not showing you everything - we're showing you what matters RIGHT NOW."

---

## SLIDE 9: Demo - HM Friction Analysis

### Visual
Screenshot of HM scorecard showing:
- Table of HMs ranked by latency
- Highlight one HM with 8-day avg feedback time vs 2-day team average
- "Candidates lost while waiting" metric

### Speaker Notes
> "This is where we solve the black box problem. Every hiring manager gets a scorecard showing their feedback latency. This isn't about blame - it's about finding where candidates are waiting and fixing it. One HM with 8-day latency can tank your entire TTF even if everyone else is at 2 days."

---

## SLIDE 10: The Math - How Latency Kills TTF

### Visual
Two scenarios side by side:

**Scenario A: Fast HM**
\`\`\`
Source → Screen (3d) → HM Review (2d) → Onsite (5d) → Offer (2d)
Total: 12 days
\`\`\`

**Scenario B: Slow HM**
\`\`\`
Source → Screen (3d) → HM Review (12d) → Onsite (5d) → Offer (2d)
Total: 22 days (+83%)
\`\`\`

### Speaker Notes
> "Let me show you the math. Same candidate, same process, one variable changes: HM review time. Going from 2 days to 12 days adds 10 days to your TTF and increases candidate drop-off risk by 3x. This is the single biggest lever most TA teams aren't pulling."

---

## SLIDE 11: Demo - Data Health

### Visual
Show Data Health dashboard with:
- Zombie req count and list
- Ghost candidate count
- "True TTF" vs "Raw TTF" comparison (e.g., 41 days vs 65 days)

### Speaker Notes
> "Here's a question: What's your real TTF? If you're including zombie reqs that have been dead for 6 months but never closed, your number is wrong. PlatoVue automatically identifies data quality issues and shows you the TRUE metric alongside the raw one."

---

## SLIDE 12: Zombie Detection Explained

### Visual
Definition card:

**ZOMBIE REQ**
\`\`\`
Status: "Open" in ATS
Reality: No candidates in 30+ days
         No activity in 30+ days
         Not paused/on-hold

Impact: Inflates TTF by 15-40%
        Hides real performance
        Wastes capacity planning
\`\`\`

### Speaker Notes
> "A zombie req is one that's technically open but functionally dead. These accumulate in every ATS because closing reqs is a manual process people forget. They corrupt every metric you have - TTF, capacity planning, even headcount reporting."

---

## SLIDE 13: Demo - Ask PlatoVue

### Visual
Screenshot of conversational interface:

**User:** "Why is time to offer so high this quarter?"

**PlatoVue:** "Time to offer increased from 18 days (Q2) to 26 days (Q3).
The primary driver is HM Review stage, which averaged 11 days vs 5 days last quarter.

Top contributors:
- Engineering HMs: +4 days avg
- Sales HMs: +2 days avg

[Citation: explain.time_to_offer.stage_breakdown]"

### Speaker Notes
> "Ask PlatoVue lets you query your data in plain English. Ask 'what's on fire?' and get the top risks. Ask 'why is TTF high?' and get a stage-by-stage breakdown with specific HMs called out. Every number cites its source - no hallucinated metrics."

---

## SLIDE 14: Demo - Forecasting

### Visual
Forecast panel showing:
\`\`\`
Open Reqs:        25
Expected Hires:   18.3
Gap:              6.7 reqs at risk
Confidence:       Medium

Recommendation: Prioritize sourcing for 7
                highest-risk reqs
\`\`\`

### Speaker Notes
> "This isn't just counting open reqs - it's probability-weighting every candidate in your pipeline based on their stage and how long they've been there. A candidate in offer stage counts more than one in phone screen. A candidate stuck in a stage for 3 weeks gets discounted. This tells you what's actually going to happen."

## SLIDE 15: How The Data Pipeline Works

### Visual
Flow diagram:

\`\`\`
┌─────────────┐
│ ATS Export  │  Raw CSV from iCIMS/Greenhouse/etc
└──────┬──────┘
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│ Smart Parse │  Auto-detect columns, report type
└──────┬──────┘
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│ Normalize   │  Map stages to canonical names
└──────┬──────┘
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│ Clean       │  Flag zombies, ghosts, bad data
└──────┬──────┘

└──────┬──────┘
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│ Alert       │  Detect risks, generate actions
└─────────────┘
\`\`\`

### Speaker Notes
> "Under the hood, we're doing sophisticated data processing that would take hours manually. Stage normalization means 'Phone Screen', 'Recruiter Call', and 'Initial Interview' all map to the same canonical stage so your funnel analysis works. Data cleaning automatically flags problems so your metrics are trustworthy."

---

## SLIDE 16: Stage Normalization Example

### Visual
Table showing mapping:

| Your ATS Says | PlatoVue Maps To |
|---------------|------------------|
| "Recruiter Phone Screen" | SCREEN |
| "Initial Phone Interview" | SCREEN |
| "Hiring Manager Interview" | HM_SCREEN |
| "HM Video Call" | HM_SCREEN |
| "Onsite Day" | ONSITE |
| "Virtual Onsite Loop" | ONSITE |

### Speaker Notes
> "This is why comparing data across time or across companies is usually impossible - everyone names things differently. We normalize to canonical stages, which means your funnel analysis stays consistent even if you renamed 'Phone Screen' to 'Intro Call' last year."

---

## SLIDE 17: Security & Your Data

### Visual
Three security pillars:

1. **Data Isolation**
   - Row-level security
   - Org-level access control
   - Your data never mixes with others

2. **AI Key Protection**
   - Zero-knowledge encryption
   - Keys encrypted in your browser
   - Server never sees plaintext

3. **PII Handling**
   - Names anonymized before AI
   - No raw records to external services
   - Only aggregated metrics

### Speaker Notes
> "Quick note on security since I know this comes up. Your data is isolated at the row level - there's no way for another org to see your data. If you use the AI features, your API keys are encrypted with a passphrase before they ever leave your browser. And we never send candidate PII to AI services - everything is anonymized first."

---

## SLIDE 18: Time to Value

### Visual
Timeline:

\`\`\`
Day 0          Day 1           Week 1          Month 1
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
First import   Full dashboard  Team trained    Measurable
(5 min)        (same day)      (self-serve)    improvement
\`\`\`

### Speaker Notes
> "This isn't a 6-month implementation project. Import your first CSV, get insights immediately. Full dashboard populated same day. Most teams are self-sufficient within a week and seeing measurable process improvement within 30 days."

---

## SLIDE 19: ROI Scenarios

### Visual
Three ROI examples:

**Scenario 1: Reduce TTF by 5 days**
- Cost per day of open req: ~$500
- 50 hires/year × 5 days × $500 = **$125K saved**

**Scenario 2: Improve accept rate 5%**
- Cost per declined offer: ~$15K (re-sourcing)
- 100 offers × 5% improvement = 5 saves = **$75K saved**

**Scenario 3: Close zombie reqs faster**
- 30 zombie reqs × 40 hrs recruiter time = 1,200 hrs
- Reallocated to active reqs = **2-3 additional hires**

### Speaker Notes
> "Let me put some numbers to this. If we can shave 5 days off your TTF - which is conservative based on the HM latency data - that's $125K in reduced cost-of-vacancy for a mid-size team. Improving accept rate saves re-sourcing costs. And closing zombies frees up recruiter capacity that's currently being wasted."
